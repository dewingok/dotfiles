# dotfiles

_Warning: These are my personal dotfiles, which are highly opinionated and in various states of "working". Use at your own risk._

## What's in the box? ðŸ“¦

- **Neovim Configuration** (`nvim/`) - A carefully crafted development environment
- **Zsh Setup** (`zsh/`) - My stripped down shell configuration
- **Other Configurations** (`tmux/`, `git/`, etc) - Other things I use that I don't want to reconfigure
- **Scripts** (`scripts/`) - Random utilities including `backyuppy` (because I can't just be normal) and AWS session management
- **Brewfile** - All the tools I ~~can't live without~~ only bother to update when I get a new laptop

## Installation ðŸš€

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Install everything (may take a while, go make coffee)
make install

# Or if you're feeling adventurous
./install.sh
```

## Support ðŸ†˜

There is no stinking support. But, if something breaks:

1. Google your error message
2. "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
3. Blame solar flares

## License ðŸ“„

MIT License - Use it, abuse it, improve it, or ignore it completely. I'm not your mom.
